# School Programme Tracker — Sri Lanka

Interactive map tracking schools through three stages: Screening, Teacher Training, and Completed.

## Live site
Once GitHub Pages is enabled for this repo, your map will be at
`https://AakifAhmedd.github.io/school-tracker-map/`

## How the data works
`index.html` loads its markers from **`schools.csv`** in this same folder at page-load time.
The two files must stay together in the repo root.

CSV columns: `name, lat, lng, stage, notes`
`stage` must be one of: `screening`, `training`, `completed`

## Updating the list (the PR workflow)
1. On GitHub, open `schools.csv` and click the pencil (Edit) icon — or edit it locally and push a branch.
2. Add, remove, or change rows.
3. Open a Pull Request with the change. Reviewers see a clean row-by-row diff.
4. Once the PR is merged into `main`, the live map picks up the new data automatically (GitHub Pages redeploys within ~a minute — no need to touch `index.html`).

## Local testing
Opening `index.html` by double-clicking it won't load `schools.csv` (browsers block that fetch for local files).
Either run a local server (e.g. `python3 -m http.server` in this folder and visit `http://localhost:8000`), or use the **Load a CSV** button in the sidebar to preview a file manually.
